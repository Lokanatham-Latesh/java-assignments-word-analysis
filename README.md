This Core Java assignment provides a tool for analyzing word frequency and statistics in text files. The program reads a .txt file and performs various analyses, such as counting words, characters, and lines, while excluding common articles and auxiliary verbs. It also calculates the frequency of each unique word and outputs the results in a Result.txt file.

The tool performs the following key operations:

Word and Character Count: Counts valid words (excluding articles and auxiliary verbs) and characters (excluding spaces). Word Frequency Analysis: Tracks the frequency of each unique word in the text, sorted in descending order. Exclusion of Auxiliary Verbs: Excludes common auxiliary verbs like “a”, “an”, “the”, “is”, and “was” to focus on meaningful content. Line Count: Provides the total number of lines in the text file. The results are written to an output file, Result.txt, making it easy to review the analysis. The program also includes error handling to ensure only valid .txt files are processed and provides feedback for incorrect file paths or invalid files.

By completing this assignment, I have covered several important Core Java topics:

File Handling: Reading files using FileReader and BufferedReader. String Manipulation: Utilizing regular expressions to clean words (e.g., removing punctuation). Data Structures: Using ArrayList for storing excluded words and HashMap for word frequency tracking. Stream Sorting: Sorting word frequencies in descending order using Java streams. This project helped me strengthen my skills in file processing, text analysis, and data manipulation, covering essential Java concepts.
